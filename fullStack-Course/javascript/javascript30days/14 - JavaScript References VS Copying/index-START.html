    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    let age2 = 100;
    
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
    const team = players
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Lux'
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players)
    console.log(team)
    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    // one way
    const team4 = players.slice()
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team2 = [].concat(players)
    
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team3 = [...players]

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    
    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
    const team5 = Array.from(players)

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const obj2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99})

    console.log(obj2)
    console.log(person)
    console.log(captain)
     lly soon see the object ...spread
    const obj3 = {...person}
    console.log(obj3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    const wes = {
      name:'Wes',
      age: 50,
      social: {
        twitter: '@aaa',
        facebook: 'wesbos@email.com'
      }
    };

    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes)
    console.log(wes)
    console.log(dev)
    // dev.social.twitter = '@aegr'
    
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes))
    
    dev2.social.twitter = '@aegraa'
    console.log(wes)
    console.log(dev2)
